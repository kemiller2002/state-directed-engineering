# Four-Tier Architecture

Status: `supported` theory (see `TH-SDE-2026-0001`), REQUIRED as SDE's
canonical architectural layering.

## Naming note (read this first)

This is an **SDE-migration-era synthesis**: the exact "Semantic Model /
Transition / Orchestration / Host" tier vocabulary was assigned during the
State Programming → SDE migration to name a layering directly observable in
HelixNote's actual, enforced codebase structure — not copied verbatim from a
single HelixNote document. **It is not the same concept as HelixNote's own
"Four-Tier State-System Model"** (`HELIXNOTE-FOUR-TIER-CONFORMANCE-AUDIT.md`,
attributed there to an external "Echelon Foundry" brief), which classifies
kinds of state (Domain/Entity, Workflow/Process, Effect/External,
Presentation/Interaction) rather than architectural layers. Full
disambiguation and evidence: `research/evidence/EV-HN-2026-0001--*.md`. Do
not merge the two.

## The four tiers

### Tier 1 — Semantic Model

**Question:** What can be true?

Includes: domain identifiers, values, closed alternatives, state-specific
data, evidence, capabilities, obligations, uncertainty.

Must not know about: Postgres, HTTP, JSON, frameworks, browser APIs,
serialization, filesystems, infrastructure.

*HelixNote evidence:* `domain/HelixNote.Semantic` targets `netstandard2.0`
and references only `FSharp.Core`, so it structurally cannot reference
Npgsql, ASP.NET Core, or Giraffe. `scripts/check-semantic-architecture.sh`
verifies this mechanically, and passed on every architecture and condition
across all three experiments.

### Tier 2 — State Transition / Domain Execution

**Question:** What legal change may happen?

Includes: commands/intents, transitions, guards, invariants, evidence
requirements, capability requirements, outcomes, obligations, requested
effects.

Does not perform uncontrolled infrastructure effects — effects are
requested as data and executed by Tier 4.

### Tier 3 — Application / Projection / Orchestration

Coordinates use cases, projections, commands, requested effects, and
boundary translation. Must not become a second semantic authority — if
Tier 3 starts making its own decisions about what states are legal, the
Tier 1/2 boundary has failed.

*HelixNote evidence:* `api/` dispatches commands into the semantic core and
executes the effects it returns (per `HELIXNOTE-HANDLER-INTEGRATION-DESIGN.md`),
rather than re-deciding review semantics itself.

### Tier 4 — Host / External Effects

Owns database, network, HTTP, browser, filesystem, clock, queue, framework,
external services, and WASM/browser interop. Reports what actually
happened — including "we do not know what happened" as an explicit,
first-class outcome, not a swallowed exception.

*HelixNote evidence:* `domain/HelixNote.Semantic.Host.Postgres`,
`.Host.Wasm`, `.Host.Wasm.Browser`, `web-bolero/`, `web/`. Four hosts
(in-process, PostgreSQL, Giraffe HTTP, WASM/browser) were added across the
pilot's slices without changing a line of the Tier 1/2 core.

## Dependency direction

```
Host / Infrastructure
        |
        v
Application / Orchestration
        |
        v
Transition / Domain Execution
        |
        v
Semantic Model
```

Dependencies point downward only. Tier 1 never imports from Tier 2, 3, or 4.

## What this doctrine does not claim

- It does not claim this four-way split is the only viable layering, or
  that it has been validated outside HelixNote/F#. See `TH-SDE-2026-0001`
  for confidence and limitations.
- It does not claim the tiers, on their own, prevent boundary failures when
  values cross between them — that is Boundary Preservation's job
  (`BOUNDARY-PRESERVATION.md`), not the tiering's.
