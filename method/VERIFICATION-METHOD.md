# Verification Method

Status: RECOMMENDED as a mapping; EXPERIMENTAL as a claim of completeness.

## Core principle

> Every required change obligation should become mechanically visible at
> the earliest reliable layer capable of knowing it.

This is not the same claim as "the compiler should detect everything." Every
HelixNote trial to date found at least one defect class no layer in this
list catches short of behavioral verification (see below).

## Enforcement mapping

| Failure class | Detected by |
|---|---|
| Missing semantic case | compiler / exhaustiveness checking |
| Architecture violation (a tier depending on something it must not) | architecture check |
| Boundary disagreement (representation collapse, uncoordinated duplication) | boundary/contract check |
| Persistence disagreement (a schema doesn't admit what the semantic model allows) | persistence/schema agreement check |
| Present-but-wrong implementation (compiles, passes every static/contract check, does the wrong or no work) | behavioral/integration test |
| External/untyped mismatch | runtime validation at re-entry |
| Unknown external outcome | explicit uncertainty state + reconciliation |

## Evidence for each row

- Missing semantic case → compiler: Experiment 1 found 8 of 12 required
  sites (67%) caught this way with zero repository search
  [EV-HN-2026-0003].
- Architecture violation → architecture check:
  `check-semantic-architecture.sh` passed in every trial across all three
  experiments, on both architectures [EV-HN-2026-0003, EV-HN-2026-0004,
  EV-HN-2026-0005].
- Boundary disagreement → boundary/contract check: Target A (SQL CHECK
  agreement) and Target C(b) (field-vocabulary agreement) in Experiment 2
  [EV-HN-2026-0004]; the boundary investigation's BP-002 route-agreement
  script [EV-HN-2026-0002].
- Persistence disagreement → persistence/schema agreement check: Target A
  specifically [EV-HN-2026-0004].
- **Present-but-wrong implementation → behavioral/integration test.** This
  row is the load-bearing exception to "the compiler can catch everything."
  A structurally-present, semantically-inert fan-out arm evaded the
  compiler, the architecture check, Target A, and Target C(b) identically
  in Experiment 2 (Phase 20) and both conditions of Experiment 3 (§17,
  §22) [EV-HN-2026-0004, EV-HN-2026-0005]. Caught only by an integration
  test asserting the real effect happened, confirmed by direct SQL query.
  **This check is REQUIRED for any change that adds or modifies a fan-out
  or dispatch arm whose body is not itself type-checked against its
  semantic input**, not merely recommended.
- External/untyped mismatch → runtime validation: the boundary
  investigation's Deliverable 5 principle — external/untyped data must be
  validated before becoming trusted semantic state [EV-HN-2026-0002].
- Unknown external outcome → explicit uncertainty state: `CommitOutcome`/
  `CorrectionWriteOutcome`-style "definite success / definite failure /
  unknown" reporting, referenced across Experiments 1 and 2's own
  architecture notes.

## What "earliest reliable layer" means in practice

Do not add a slow check (behavioral test, live integration proof) for
something a fast check (compiler, architecture check) can already catch
reliably. Do not rely on a fast check for something evidence shows it
cannot catch (a present-but-inert arm) merely because the fast check
happens to run cleanly.

## Known gap, stated rather than hidden

Experiment 3 found the entire API/HTTP correction tier has **zero**
mechanical guard on either HelixNote architecture tested (BS3-01,
[EV-HN-2026-0005]). Until a mechanism is built and evidenced for that tier,
treat any change reaching the API/HTTP tier as requiring manual
verification at that tier specifically, in addition to whatever mechanical
checks cover the tiers it also touches.
