# Change Classification

Status: EXPERIMENTAL. Classify every change into exactly one of the four
classes below before starting the Construction Method. When a change seems
to span classes, split it into separate changes rather than picking the
most ceremonious class for the whole thing.

## Semantic Change

Changes what can be true, or what legal evolution means. Lives in Tier 1/2
of the Four-Tier Architecture.

Examples: state, transitions, invariants, evidence, capability, obligations,
effect semantics, uncertainty.

Goes through the **Full Path** of the Construction Method.

## Boundary Change

Changes representation or communication across a Tier boundary or across
the system's edge.

Examples: wire shape, API, route, persistence, serializer, parser,
browser/WASM contract, external protocol.

Goes through the Boundary Change path: explicit boundary decision, contract
verification, host/integration verification.

## Mechanical Propagation

No new semantic decision. A previously made decision must be propagated
because a compiler, architecture check, or other tooling exposed the
obligation (e.g., an `FS0025`-style exhaustiveness error after a Semantic
Change was already made elsewhere).

Goes through the Fast Path: mechanically directed repair, then focused
verification.

**Important, evidenced distinction:** a Mechanical Propagation site is not
automatically "free" or "safe." Experiment 1 [EV-HN-2026-0003] found that
even a compiler-forced site can be filled in with a value that compiles,
passes every existing check, and is still wrong — mechanical discovery of
*that a site needs an answer* is not the same as mechanical verification of
*whether the answer given is correct*. A behavior test remains warranted for
any Mechanical Propagation site whose content is not itself mechanically
checked (e.g., a fan-out arm's body, as opposed to its mere existence).

## Presentation Change

Display/interaction changes that do not change domain semantics.

Goes through the Fast Path: local change, then focused verification. Do not
force the full Semantic Change ceremony onto presentation-only work.

## Classifying a change that touches multiple tiers

A single requirement often produces work in more than one class (e.g., a new
`ObservedValue` case is a Semantic Change at Tier 1/2 *and* triggers
Mechanical Propagation at several Tier 2/4 sites *and* a Boundary Change at
the API/wire layer). This is normal and evidenced directly — Experiment 1
found 1 semantic decision produced 5 boundary decisions and 8 mechanical
propagations across 8 files [EV-HN-2026-0003]. Track each site's class
individually; do not classify the whole requirement as one thing.

## What this classification does not yet resolve

It does not yet specify a mechanical test for "is this Mechanical Propagation
or a disguised Semantic Change" beyond "did a new semantic decision get
made, however small." This is flagged as an open method question, not
silently resolved — see `research/CHRONOLOGY.md`'s open-questions carryover
and `WI-0018` (first engineering validation design) for where this should be
tested against a real project.
